Topics: Method Overloading

package name: day25_CusomMethod_Overloading

Warmup tasks:
	Task1:
	    1. create a method that can find the sum of two numbers
	                    method name: sumOf2Numbers

	    2. create a method that can find the sum of three numbers
	                    method name: sumOf3Numbers

	    3. create a method that can find the sum of four numbers
	                    method name: sumOf4Numbers

	Task2:
		1. create a return method called addInteger that can add an Inteeger  after the  last index of an integer array

					{1,2,3,4}, 5
					new array ==> {1,2,3,4,5}

	    2. create a return method called addDouble that can add a double after the last index of a double array

	    3. create a return method called addString that can add a String after the last index of a String array

	    4. create a return method called addChar that can add a char after last index of a char array



Method Overloading: multiple different methods sharing the same method name
			same method name, different parameters

			return type, access modifiers and specifiers can be same or can be different

			Advantage:
				1. easy to memorize
				2. easy to read
				3. reusable
				4. flexible




Task3:
	1. create a method that can merge two integer arrays.  		merger(int[] arr1, int[] arr2)

	2. create a method that can merge two double arrays.  		merge(double[] arr1, double[] arr2)

	3. create a method that can merge two char arrays.   		merge(char[] arr1, char[] arr2)

	4. create a method that can merge two String arrays.  		merge(String[] arr1, String[] arr2)

			merge()


Task 4:
	1. create a method that can return the max number from an integer array

	2. create a method that can return the max number from double array

	3. create a method that can return the max number from long array

	4. create a method that can return the max number from short array

	5. create a method that can return the max number from float array

	6. create a method that can return the max number from byte array


Task 5:
	1. create a method that can return the min number from an integer array

	2. create a method that can return the min number from double array

	3. create a method that can return the min number from long array

	4. create a method that can return the min number from short array

	5. create a method that can return the min number from float array

	6. create a method that can return the min number from byte array



Task 6:
	1. Create a method that can reverse an integer array

	2. Create a method that can reverse a double array

	3. Create a method that can reverse a char array

	4. Create a method that can reverse a String array
